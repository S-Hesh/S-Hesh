# Hi, I'm Sakindu Ranepura

### **Professional Profile**
I am a **Full-Stack Developer** with a deep-rooted mastery of **Core Java, OOP, and SOLID principles**. I specialize in architecting enterprise-grade systems using **MVC and Layered Architectures**, with a focus on industry-standard design patterns like **Singleton** for efficient resource management. 

I am a **highly versatile and fast learner**, capable of seamlessly switching between technology stacks—including backend (Java, Go, PHP) and frontend (Svelte, TypeScript, Java Swing). By leveraging **AI-driven development**, I optimize my workflow to rapidly master new technologies and deliver high-performance, real-world solutions.
